I hold a dual engineering degree from <a href="https://artsetmetiers.fr/en" target="_blank">Arts et Métiers ParisTech</a> in Mechanical Engineering and a Master of Science from <a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/programs/sys" target="_blank">UC Berkeley in Systems Engineering & Data Science</a>.

At Berkeley, I worked as a Graduate Student Researcher at the <a href="https://humnetlab.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">HumNet Lab</a> for the <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/data-science-framework-measure-vehicle-miles-traveled-mode-and-purpose" target="_blank">California Air Resources Board</a>, analyzing the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on mobility patterns. I processed billions of mobile data to inform state-level emission reduction policies — an experience that strengthened my interest in data-driven decision-making with tangible societal impact.

Back in France, I joined the French Interior Ministry (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/patrick-perrot_ia-activity-7074803626442940417-akvv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACc4pCMBfG9wMxw7Jjb53oexLHRD-DYRYRE" target="_blank">General Directorate of the National Gendarmerie</a>) as an AI Engineer intern, working on applied deep learning projects such as deepfake detection and facial composite generation for law enforcement.

After graduating, I underwent selection and training within the <a href="https://www.sengager.fr/tous-nos-regiments/1er-regiment-de-parachutistes-dinfanterie-de-marine" target="_blank">1st RPIMa</a> - a French special forces regiment specialized in counter-terrorism and intelligence operations - as a paratrooper. This experience taught me resilience, effective teamwork, reliability under pressure, and sustained focus in high-stakes environments.

I am now looking to apply my skills in data science/analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to solve meaningful problems and contribute to impactful, real-world projects.
