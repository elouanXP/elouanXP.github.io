## Background

I hold a dual engineering degree from **Arts et Métiers ParisTech** (mechanical, industrial & energy engineering) and a **MSc from UC Berkeley** (Systems Engineering & Data Science, Civil & Environmental Engineering department).

After graduating, I joined the **1er RPIMa** — France's premier special forces regiment — as a paratrooper. This experience sharpened my ability to operate under pressure, make fast decisions with incomplete information, and stay focused on outcomes in high-stakes environments.

I'm now transitioning back to data & AI, bringing both a solid technical foundation and an operational mindset to build systems that work in the real world.
